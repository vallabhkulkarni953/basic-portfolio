<p>I am Vallabh Kulkarni, a student from Pimpri Chinchwad College of Engineering, Pune, India. I am keen enthusiast of Web Development and looking forward to create amazing and creative websites that would impact the world and make the life of people easier.</p>

<p>Coming from a small village named <a href="https://www.google.com/maps?sca_esv=d34e0a7206c3ba5b&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN1012IN1013&output=search&q=malkapur&source=lnms&fbs=AEQNm0CRraR4AFMOJtZDUPiZk_hDEGW7EwGJ8ltzg0fUf3C5XWVtbNyXQ2O9tu-QXEXaNZnUwgScAJeS1n2klNZ6F_aYvbIec80_-NVcnr8-ByXDaDFB8HYsHtsTWD9yGLZQLAuCaIm7Yve-lxLyJR_jZURNXfdy2-4jRuzk24PqALcw0dBtAUXsQAFl6vnHIjjZ-BtuiNoR3z5u2TUgrEsDgizst7WTMw&entry=mc&ved=1t:200715&ictx=111">Malkapur</a>, from Buldhana District, I completed my primary education from <b>Liladhar Bhojaraj Chandak, Vidyalaya, Malkapur</b> and completed my Secondary School Certificate (SSC) with a score of <i>96.60%</i>. Undoubtedly, I was the <b>topper</b> from my Taluka at that year. Further, I completed my Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC) with a of <i>99.33%</i> from <b>Mauli Junior College Of Science, Akola</b>. It was the time of COVID-19 and affected my study and learning due to huge paradigm shift from Offline Classes to Online Classes. Yet, I cracked the Exams of JEE Mains 2020 with <b>95.52 percentile</b> and MHTCET with <b>98.02 percentile</b>.</p>

<p> Currently, I am pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the well known college in Pimpri Chinchwad, that is, Pimpri Chinchwad College of Engineering, Nigdi. I am aiming to become a full stack developer and create the amazing magical websites that never thought could be existed.</p>
